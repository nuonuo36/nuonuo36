## Sum

The sum of an arithmetic squence is always: **number of terms $$\cdot$$ average of terms**

* If $$d=1$$:

number of terms = $$a_n - a_1 +1$$ 

average of terms = $$\frac{a_n+a_1}{2}$$

S_n = $$(a_n - a_1 +1)\cdot(\frac{a_n+a_1}{2})$$


* If $$d\neq 1$$:

number of terms = $$\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} +1$$ 

average of terms = $$\frac{a_n+a_1}{2}$$

S_n = $$(\frac{a_n - a_1}{d}+1)\cdot(\frac{a_n+a_1}{2})$$


**note**: $$S_i$$ is the sum of the 1~$$i$$th term, $$a_i$$ is the $$i$$th term, $$d$$ is the common difference, and $$n$$ is the number of terms
