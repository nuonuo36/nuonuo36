## Setting variables


## Use $$a^{2}=b^{2}$$ to prove $$a=b$$

## Changing form of answer
e.g. if asked for the sum of the reciprocal of a and b:
$$\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}=\frac{a+b}{ab}$$
now you just have to find the sum and product of a and b!

## $$(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ac)$$



## $$(a+b)^n = $$
* Importantly, **(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+c^2**

## $$a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b)$$
